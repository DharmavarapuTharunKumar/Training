Function Design and Modularization - Create a document that describes the design of two modular functions: one that returns the factorial of a number, and another that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Include pseudocode and
a brief explanation of how modularity in programming helps with code reuse and organization.

1. Function to Calculate Factorial:

Function factorial(number)
    result = 1
    FOR i from 1 to number DO
        result = result * i
    ENDFOR
    return result
EndFunction


2. Function to Calculate Fibonacci Number:

Function fibonacci(n)
    IF n = 0 THEN
        return 0
    ELSE IF n = 1 THEN
        return 1
    ELSE
        Initialize variables a and b to 0 and 1 respectively
        FOR i from 2 to n DO
            temp = a + b
            a = b
            b = temp
        ENDFOR
        return b
    ENDIF
EndFunction
